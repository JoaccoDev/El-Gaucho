- Basic SEO.

## DEMONSTRATION

To see an online demo (from GitHub Pages) of my project, simply [click on this text](https://joagcoder.github.io/4ta-Entrega/).

## INSTALLATION

Anyone is free to download my files either to look at them more in depth, modify something or recommend changes or improvements that could be relevant.
> To download the entire repository, you must go to [this link] (https://github.com/JoagCoder/ElGaucho). Then, click on the "Code" button at the top right.
>
> Click where it says "Download ZIP" and choose the location where you want your download.

## USE

Because the styles of my final project were applied from SASS and, although it is not necessary, it is recommended to use it to change the styles of the site. It is important to have NodeJS and NPM downloaded on your computer first, then follow the steps below.
> Go to your console, go to the repository folder and use the following command to generate "node_modules" folder:
```cmd
npm install -D node-sass nodemon
```
> Then you must use this next command to keep track of the modifications made:
```cmd
npm run watch-css
```
Once this is done, all changes made to the files within the SCSS folder will also be automatically made to the CSS folder, as well as to the HTML pages themselves.

## CONTRIBUTION

Anyone is welcome to recommend changes and modifications that would improve the site through pull requests. For a bigger change that is related directly to main content of the page, please start an "issue" so we can discuss about what you would like to change.
