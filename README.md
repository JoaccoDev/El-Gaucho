# Final project: "El Gaucho".
## Welcome.

Final project based on the creation of a website for a restaurant located in Argentina. This project was made to achieve the "web developer" certificate.

Aspects included in the project:
- HTML.
- CSS.
- SASS.
- Responsive design.
- Basic SEO.

## Demonstration.

To see an online demo (from GitHub Pages) of my project, simply [click here](https://joagcoder.github.io/ElGaucho/).

## Installation.

Anyone is free to download my files either to look at them more in depth, modify something or recommend changes or improvements that could be relevant.
> To download the entire repository, you must go to [this link](https://github.com/JoagCoder/ElGaucho). Then, click on the "Code" button at the right-top.
>
> Click where it says "Download ZIP" and choose the location where you want your download.

## Use.

Because the styles of my final project were applied from SASS and, although it is not necessary, it is recommended to use it to change the styles of the site. It is important to have NodeJS and NPM downloaded on your computer first, then follow the steps below.
> Go to your console, go to the repository folder and use the following command to generate "node_modules" folder:
```cmd
npm install -D node-sass nodemon
```
> Then you must use this next command to keep track of the modifications made:
```cmd
npm run watch-css
```
Once this is done, all changes made to the files within the SCSS folder will also be automatically made to the CSS folder, as well as to the HTML pages themselves.

## Contribution.

Since this is a private project that I made to achieve "web developer" certification, I'm not accepting contributions.
